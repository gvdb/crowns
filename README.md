## Overview
CROWNS is a game of strategy, cunning, and luck where players manage a realm's dynasty as kings and queens reign and fall. Choose when to coronate a monarch and seat them on the throne, oversee their rule, use the aristocracy to your advantage, and amass an army to protect your strongholds and usurp the royalty of rival kingdoms.

Kings come and go, but the crown endures.

## Setup
1.	Determine the dealer in whatever random way players choose
1.	For a 2 player game, shuffle a deck of 52 standard playing cards (A – K, four suits)
1.	The dealer deals, one by one, 5 cards to each player
1.	Any player may choose to "mulligan" by having a new hand dealt and shuffling the cards from their original hand back into the deck. Players can only mulligan once at the start of the game
1.	Place the remaining Deck of cards between players. Each player will draw from this Deck
1.	The player to the left of the dealer goes first and the order of players proceeds clockwise

## Play Areas
In CROWNS each player manages their own play area i.e. their Realm. A Realm consists of a House, Throne, Stronghold, Tombs, and Troop Rally Points (four for each player). At the beginning of the game, besides the Deck and the 5 cards in the players' hands (represented by their Stronghold), all areas are empty. The figure below is an example of an in-progress 2 player game. It illustrates the following:
* __Deck:__ Where players draw cards from
* __Strongholds:__ Represents the players' hands of cards
* __Thrones:__ Where Kings, Queens, and Jacks can be “coronated” (face down) and advanced
* __Houses:__ Where scored or stolen Kings and Queens are placed (face up)
* __Tombs:__ Where discarded cards are placed (face up or face down)
* __Rally Points / Troops:__ Empty Rally Points and Troops that have been rallied in front of Strongholds and Thrones (face up or face down)

## Playing the Game
Play progresses clock-wise, starting with the first player to the left of the dealer. A player's turn consists of three phases in the following order (DAD):
1.	__Draw:__ At the beginning of their turn the player must draw one card from the Deck and add it to their Stronghold (i.e. hand)
2.	__Actions:__ The player has three actions they may use on particular abilities
3.	__Discard:__ If the player has more than 5 cards in their Stronghold they must discard down to 5 cards. If they have 5 or less cards this phase is skipped

### Draw Phase
* A player's turn is started by drawing 1 card from the top of the Deck and adding it to their Stronghold
* A player cannot pass on this step
* This step doesn't cost an action. Actions are only used in the Action Phase
* If there are no cards in the Deck when the player begins their turn, this step is skipped and the player is allowed to finish their turn

### Action Phase
* The player then has 3 actions they may use on their turn
* Players can pass on any actions in their turn
* The actions available to a player are (DCARR):
    + __Draw:__ The player takes the top card from the Deck and adds it to their Stronghold
    + __Coronate:__ The player takes a card (J, Q, K) from their Stronghold and places it, face down, on the Throne (the area to their right)
    + __Advance:__ The player places a card (A – J), face down, on a card already on the Throne to advance it
    + __Rally:__ The player places a card or cards (A – J) on rally points in front of their Throne or Stronghold
    + __Recall__: The player can return already rallied Troops back to their Stronghold. Note: If rallying new Troops where there are existing Troops, the existing Troops are automatically recalled to the Stronghold without having to spend an additional action for the recall
    + __Raid:__ The player attacks an opponent's realm. If the player can pass all Rallied Troops defending a Throne or Stronghold they may access cards from the raided target. A player's House and Tombs can not be raided. The Deck cannot be raided

### Discard Phase
* Once all three actions are spent, or the player passes on their actions, if they have more than 5 cards in their Stronghold they must discard down to 5 cards
* If the player has 5 or less cards in their Stronghold they are not allowed to discard any cards and this phase is skipped
* Besides Kings and Queens, cards are discarded to the Tombs area
* The player may remove Kings or Queens from their Stronghold during this phase, but they can't discard them to the Tombs. Instead they add them back to the Deck
    + To do this they show their opponent(s) the Kings/Queens they are removing from their Stronghold, the opponent to their left then randomly cuts them back into the Deck. The dealer then shuffles the Deck
* The next player, in clock-wise order, begins their turn

#### Tombs
* Cards are placed in the Tombs either face up or face down, based on their state at the time they are discarded i.e. if all players know what the cards are at the time they are discarded they are placed in the Tombs face up
* A player may inspect any face up cards in the Tombs at any time during play. This is true of the player's own Tombs or viewing the opponent(s)

## Objective
To win the game a player must score or steal 5 points worth of King and Queen cards.

## Cards
### Kings and Queens
* The following things can be done to these cards:
    + __Coronated:__ Place on the Throne face down to be advanced, and then scored (or stolen by an opposing player)
    + __Advanced:__ Once placed on the Throne Kings and Queens can be advanced. To be scored Kings must be advanced 4 times, and Queens 3 times
    + __Scored or Stolen:__ When scored or stolen a King or Queen is placed in the House area of the player who possesses it. Kings are worth 2 points and Queens are worth 1 point
* Kings and Queens can't be used for advancing, rallying, reinforcing, payment, or any other purpose
* If the player doesn't want Kings or Queens in their Stronghold, during the Discard Phase of their turn they can be shuffled back into the Deck. The player can only do this if it doesn't bring the number of cards in their Stronghold below 5

### Numbered (A – 10)
* These cards can be used for:
    + __Rallying Troops:__ By placing the card(s) as Troops on a rally point in front of the player's Stronghold or Throne. Troops are used for both defending and attacking during Raids
    + __Advancing:__ By placing the card, face down, on a card on the Throne. Once a card is removed from the Throne the cards used for advancing it are discarded
    + __Reinforcing:__ By placing the card, face down, on existing Troops during a Raid. This does not cost an action. Once a Raid ends any cards used for reinforcing are discarded. Cards used for reinforcement are placed face down because their face value and suit are not used
    + __Payment:__ By placing the card, face down, next to the Jack the toll is being paid for in encountered Troops during a raid. Can also be used for payment when encountering a Jack in the opponent's Stronghold
* Numbered cards can't be placed on the Throne (i.e. coronated) like Kings, Queens or Jacks

### Jacks (The Jack of all Trades)
* Can be used in all the same ways that numbered cards are used i.e. can be used for advancing, reinforcing, payment, and rallying Troops 
* Treated like a 10 for strength when rallied as a Troop card
* Also has these additional abilities:
    + __On the Throne:__ Can be placed on the Throne like a King or Queen (i.e. coronated) to be advanced as a “False Crown”
        - The Jack can't be scored and awards no points. Advancing has no effect other than to make the deception to the other player(s) more convincing
        - If accessed by a Raiding player (in the defending player's Throne) the defending player can remove a pair of Troop cards from a rally point of the raiding player's Throne or Stronghold. The Jack is then discarded
        - If a Jack is currently on a player's Throne and they want to put another card there, the Jack and any cards used to advance it are discarded to Tombs
    + __As a Troop:__ If placed as a part of a Troop it adds the additional requirement that the Raiding player must discard a card from their Stronghold to pass it, known as a toll. The Raiding player must still be able to match the strength of the Troops encountered to pass. Cards used to pay a toll are placed face down next to the Jack for which the toll is being paid. These cards are then discarded once the Raid ends
    + __In the Stronghold:__ During a Raid if a Jack is accessed from the defending player's Stronghold the Jack returns to the defending player's Stronghold and the raiding player must discard one card from their Stronghold to their Tombs
        - If the raiding player only has Kings or Queens, they choose one to be shuffled back into the Deck
        - If the raiding player has no cards in their Stronghold the raid ends

## Rallying
* A player has a total of four rally points where Troops can be placed; two in front of their Throne and two in front of their Stronghold. The House and Tombs have no rally points
* Troops must be placed at the innermost empty rally point
* Newly rallied Troops may be placed face down to conceal the Troop strength and suit to the opposing player. Troops already face up must remain face up i.e. they have been “scouted”
* Troops can be rallied in the following ways:
    + If placed on an empty rally point, Troops must be placed as a pair
    + To replace an existing pair on a rally point (recall existing pair to Stronghold)
    + To replace one card of an existing pair (recall replaced card to Stronghold)

## Raiding
### Initiating a Raid
* To perform a Raid, on their turn a player declares the target to Raid i.e. either the opposing player's Stronghold, or Throne. They may only choose a single target to Raid for the spent action
* The raiding player may only raid a target for which they have Troops rallied e.g. Troops must be rallied in front of the raiding player's Stronghold if they want to raid the defending player's Throne

### Accessing Target
* If there are no Troops protecting the target the Raiding player immediately gains access
* If the Raiding player accesses the __Stronghold__ they may choose a single card from the other player's Stronghold. If it is a:
    + __Numbered (A–10):__ The Raiding player may discard it if they also discard a card from their Stronghold. Otherwise the card returns to the defending player's Stronghold
    + __King or Queen:__ They may steal it and add it to their House to score it
    + __Jack:__ Then the raiding player must discard one card from their Stronghold to their Tombs. If they only have Kings or Queens they must pick one to be shuffled back into the Deck. If they have no cards, the raid ends
    + __No Cards:__ If there are no cards in the Stronghold the raid ends
* If the Raiding player accesses the __Throne__, and there is a card on it, they may see the card there. If it is a:
    + __King or Queen:__ The raiding player steals and scores it, adding it to their House
    + __Jack:__ The raiding player has fallen into a trap. The Jack is discarded and the defending player can choose to discard any pair of Troop cards from one of the raiding player's rally points
    + __No Cards:__ If there are no cards on the Throne the raid ends

### Encountering and Passing Troops
* If there are Troops protecting the Stronghold or Throne the raiding player must be able to pass them
* If the rallied Troops are face down i.e. they haven't been "scouted" yet, when the raiding player encounters them the defending player turns them face up
* To pass the opponent's Troops the raiding player may only use Troops in the same “lane” i.e. Troops in the raiding player's Throne can only counter Troops in the defending player's Stronghold, and vice-versa for countering Troops in the defending player's Throne
* Troops used during a Raid must be turned face up
* Troops are encountered starting with the outermost rallied Troops in the defending player's Realm for the target being raided
* To pass encountered Troops the raiding player must satisfy two base requirements, and one conditional requirement:
    + __Base Requirement 1:__ The Troops chosen to attack with, by the raiding player, must have a card that matches the __suit__ of one card in the defending Troops
    + __Base Requirement 2:__ The __strength__ of the raiding Troops must match the face value of the defending Troops. The raiding Troops' strength is a summation of its face values and any cards the raiding player chooses to “spend” from their Stronghold to boost its strength. Spending cards in this way is referred to as reinforcement
        - Each card spent is worth 1 strength point regardless of its face value. Cards used for reinforcement are placed face down on the Troops they are being applied to. At the end of the Raid any cards used for reinforcement are discarded
    + __Conditional Requirement:__ If any of the rally points have a Jack on it the raiding player must pay one additional card to pass it (i.e. “pay the Jack's Toll”), regardless of strength values. However, the strength requirement must still be satisfied. If there are two Jacks on a single rally point the raiding player must pay a card for each Jack. Cards spent on the Jack's Toll are placed beside the Jack whose toll is being paid. Cards used to pay a toll are discarded once a Raid ends
* Once a raiding player's Troop has been used for a Raid they can't be used again in the same Raid
* The defending player can't reinforce Troops while being raided
* A Raid ends when the raiding player encounters Troops they can't pass or they pass all the defending Troops and access the target. The raiding player may also choose to end the raid at any time i.e. even if they pass all the Troops they may choose to not access the target

## Ending the Game
* To end the game a player must score or steal 5 points worth of Kings and Queens
* The game may also end when there are no cards left in the Deck:
    + Once the last card is drawn from the Deck the player who drew the card gets to finish their turn. If they manage to reach 5 points on this turn the game ends and they win
    + Otherwise the other player(s) get to play one last turn before the game ends. If anyone reaches 5 points on their final turn the game immediately ends and they win
    + If after the final turn no player has 5 points, the player with the most points wins
    + If there's a draw on points, the player with the most Kings wins. If there are equal Kings or no Kings scored, it is a draw
* The game may also end if all other players concede, leaving a single winner

## Variant with +3 Players
The game can be played with 3 or more players:
* For each extra player shuffle a shuffled half deck of cards into the full Deck
* As an additional condition of raiding, the raiding player must declare the player they're attacking as well as the target i.e. their Throne or Stronghold
* All the same rules of raiding in a 2 player game apply once a raid is initiated between the two players
* Forming and breaking alliances between players is encouraged in games of more than two players.
