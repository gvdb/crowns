## Overview
CROWNS is a game of strategy, cunning, and luck where players manage a realm's dynasty as kings and queens reign and fall. Choose when to coronate a monarch and seat them on the throne, oversee their rule, use the aristocracy to your advantage, and amass an army to protect your strongholds and usurp the royalty of rival kingdoms.

Kings come and go, but the crown endures.
## Setup
1.	Shuffle a deck of 52 standard playing cards
2.	Determine the dealer in whatever random way players choose
3.	The dealer deals, one by one, 5 cards to each player
4.	Any player may choose to “mulligan” by having a new hand dealt and shuffling the cards from their original hand back into the deck. Players can only mulligan once at the start of the game
5.	Place the remaining deck of cards between players. Each player will draw from this deck
6.	The player to the left of the dealer goes first and the order of players proceeds clockwise
